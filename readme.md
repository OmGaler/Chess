Click "Start Game" to begin playing or "How to play" for information on how to play chess.
Once the game has started and it is your turn to move, select a piece by clicking on it and
moving it by clicking on the desired destination square, provided it is highlighted. If a square is not highlighted
then that piece cannot move there as it is an illegal move according to the rules of the game. If a piece cannot be
selected it either has no legal moves or is not its turn to play.
